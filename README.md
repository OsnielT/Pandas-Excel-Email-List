# Email-Optout
This is a script that compares an list of emails and corresponding company name (List_A) with another list of emails and corresponding company name (List_B). I row data in List_A compares to row data in List_B then add to quote to generate excel file, and all other unmatched emails will be ignored.

In this script I use Pandas, openyxl, and progress bar library.
